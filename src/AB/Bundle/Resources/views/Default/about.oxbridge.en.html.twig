            <h3>Should I apply to Oxbridge?</h3>
            <p>Yes, definitely! Many of successful Oxbridge applicants thought that they were not smart or talented enough to be accepted. The truth is, there is hardly any link between what you think of yourself and what are your odds of getting in, which is why you should apply. Chances of successful application to the prestigious Oxford and Cambridge are further increased by participating in ‘Academic Buddy’ events and preparation camps as well as by applying advice you will get from our mentors. And remember that you will also be applying to other UK universities at the same time, so even if you don’t get into Oxbridge, you will have a chance of getting an offer from other top universities in the UK.</p>

            <h3><strong>Oxbridge stage </strong><em>vs</em><strong> 2nd stage:</strong> which one to choose?</h3>
            <p>The Oxbridge stage takes place from May to October each year. This is due to the fact that the application deadline to Oxbridge is earlier than those of other universities: it’s 15th October. Pupils who wish to study in Oxbridge should apply to this stage in May or June. Yet, all pupils who are selected for the Oxbridge stage will also have the opportunity to go on to the 2nd stage if they chose so.</p>
            <p>The 2nd stage starts in September, and is for students who wish to apply to other best universities in the United Kingdom (LSE, UCL, Warwick, Edinburgh, St Andrews, etc.). The application deadline for these universities is 15th January. If you wish to get a notification about the start of the 2nd stage, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1a7g5Y34M4rClUV365ueQv9rZ-KKGAgKwgdvwv8Xyalk/viewform" target="_blank">subscribe to our newsletter</a>.</p>

            <h3>The Process</h3>    
            <p>A large part of communication with mentors happens online. In the Oxbridge stage, each accepted student will receive a mentor according to: (i) personal statement in the registration form, and (ii) his/her preferences.</p>
            <p>Communication online will start in <strong>August</strong>, and will last until the end of the application process. The mentor will likely recommend some literature to read through the summer in preparation for the tests and interviews in autumn and winter.</p>
            <p>Nearer the particular deadlines (15th October for UCAS application; special admission tests in November; interviews in December), the mentor will consult the student regarding the specifics.</p>
            <p>There will be two events in the Oxbridge stage. The first one is the opening event, which happens in June, where the organisers will inform students about the most general aspects of applications to, and life in Oxbridge. This will also give an opportunity for mentors and students to get to know each other in person. The second event is a preparation camp, happening in September, which will consist in intense two day preparation for tests and interviews.</p>
